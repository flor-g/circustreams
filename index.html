    <h2>漆継ぎ (Shitsugi / Lacquer Joinery)</h2>
    <p>
      Shitsugi (漆継ぎ), meaning “lacquer joinery,” is a traditional Japanese method of ceramic repair using urushi — natural lacquer derived from tree sap. Unlike kintsugi, which finishes the join with gold powder, shitsugi restores broken vessels using lacquer alone, leaving a deep, quiet seam.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Circustreams, we are drawn to shitsugi not as a rejection of beauty, but as a statement of it. We choose not to gild our repairs, not out of humility, but because we find richness in restraint. We appreciate the darkness of lacquer, its subtle sheen, the way it deepens with time. Our aesthetic does not seek to dazzle — it seeks to endure.

    <h2>锔瓷 (Juci / Staple Repair)</h2>
    <p>
      Juci (锔瓷), or staple repair, is a historic Chinese technique of mending ceramics by drilling tiny holes along a crack and binding the fragments together with hand-forged metal staples. Once common in everyday households, it was a practical solution — but also an art form in its own right.
    </p>
    <p>
      We practice juci at Circustreams with the same spirit: not to return an object to what it was, but to let it continue as what it has become. Each staple is a deliberate interruption, a visible suture that draws the eye — not to flaw, but to care.

    <h2>Why We Mend</h2>
    <p>
     In a home studio with the soft presence of cats and fleeting lights, broken things wait to return to life. We mend not to hide the scars, but to let time, use, and care speak through the lacquer or metal that holds each fracture together.
     In the view of East Asian philosophy, all things — living or not — are part of the great assembly of beings. People, animals, plants, vessels, stones: all are 众生 (zhòngshēng), sentient and non-sentient, each carrying their own passage through time. To mend a vessel is to meet it as a fellow being — one that has carried, broken, waited, and now asks to return. We believe the way we treat our vessels is how we treat the other and therefore the self. In repairing what is chipped or cracked, we practice a quiet respect not only for the object, but for the shared condition we all inhabit: to bear traces of time, to carry meaning, and to continue.
     Circustreams is a place of making. For those who value the time it takes to mend, the care it takes to do it well, and the quiet, resilient life of things we choose to keep close.
