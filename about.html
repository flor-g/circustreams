      <h2 class="courier-">Why We Mend</h2>
      <p class="courier-prime-regular">
      In a home studio with the soft presence of cats and fleeting lights, broken things wait to return to life. We mend not to hide the scars, but to let time, use, and care speak through the lacquer or metal that holds each fracture together.
      In the view of East Asian philosophy, all things — living or not — are part of the great assembly of beings. People, animals, plants, vessels, stones: all are 众生 (zhòngshēng), sentient and non-sentient, each carrying their own passage through time. To mend a vessel is to meet it as a fellow being — one that has carried, broken, waited, and now asks to return. We believe the way we treat our vessels is how we treat the other and therefore the self. In repairing what is chipped or cracked, we practice a quiet respect not only for the object, but for the shared condition we all inhabit: to bear traces of time, to carry meaning, and to continue.
      Circustreams is a place of making. For those who value the time it takes to mend, the care it takes to do it well, and the quiet, resilient life of things we choose to keep close.

            <h3>漆継ぎ (Shitsugi / Lacquer Joinery)</h3>
            <p>
                Shitsugi (漆継ぎ), meaning “lacquer joinery,” is a traditional Japanese method of ceramic repair using urushi — natural lacquer derived from tree sap. While kintsugi (golden joinery) is the better-known term for this practice, the term entails finishing the join with gold powder dusted on the lacquer finish. Not all of our vessels are mended in that way. We explore different finishing techniques traditionally applied on other urushi objects, such as shell-embedding, layered color finish, or just the deep and quiet black urushi finish: therefore the name Shitsugi.

            <h3>锔瓷 (Juci / Staple Repair)</h3>
            <p>
                Juci (锔瓷), or staple repair, is a historic Chinese technique of mending ceramics by drilling tiny holes along a crack and binding the fragments together with hand-forged metal staples. Once common in everyday households, it was a practical solution — but also an art form in its own right.
            </p>
            <p>
                We practice juci at Circustreams with the same spirit: not to return an object to what it was, but to let it continue as what it has become. Each staple is a deliberate interruption, a visible suture that draws the eye — not to flaw, but to care.
